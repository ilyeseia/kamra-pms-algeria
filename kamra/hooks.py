# offers. The other packs are NOT deleted - india.py, saudi.py, uae.py and the
# rest still sit in kamra/localization/ untouched, so re-enabling a country is
# one line here and merging from upstream stays clean.
#
# Consequence worth knowing before you re-enable one: a Property whose country
# is not in this map falls through to the flat-tax `generic` pack. On a site
# that only ever sells in Algeria that is the right behaviour; on a site with
# an existing Indian property it would silently change its tax vocabulary.

# injected; every deep link falls through to it so browser refresh works.
#
# The route is /ziri and the app package is still `kamra`. Those are different
# things and only the first one is a URL: /assets/kamra/ and every
# /api/method/kamra.* endpoint are named after the installed app, which this
