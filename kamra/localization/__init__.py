"""Localization seam. The core PMS never knows about GST, VAT or fiscal
printers - it asks the country pack. Packs are resolved through the
`kamra_localization` hook (ERPNext regional_overrides style), so a future
`kamra_uae` app claims its country just by declaring the hook. Countries
without a pack fall back to a plain flat-tax `generic` pack.

Interface every pack implements (see india.py):
  calculate_room_tax(property, room_type_doc, nightly_rate) -> Decimal
  fnb_tax_rate(property) -> float
  tax_rate_options(property) -> list[float]
  invoice_context(prop_doc) -> dict   (labels, service code, place of supply)
  locale(prop_doc) -> dict            (currency_symbol, locale, tax_label...)

Optional, for invoice printing - a pack that doesn't implement these gets
a sensible default from the accessors at the bottom of this file, so an
existing pack keeps working untouched:
  service_code_for(prop_doc, charge_type) -> dict | None   (per-LINE SAC/HSN)
  tax_split(prop_doc, buyer_tax_id) -> list[(label, share)]
  amount_in_words(prop_doc, amount) -> str
