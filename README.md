> **ZIRI PMS is a distribution of [Kamra PMS](https://github.com/Kamra-PMS/kamra-pms)**, the
> open-source AI-native hotel PMS by HeyKoala and contributors, localized for Algeria:
> DZD, TVA/NIF, Arabic and French interfaces, RTL, the *taxe de séjour*, and Algerian
> legal identifiers (RC · NIF · NIS · AI). Upstream copyright and the AGPL-3.0 licence are
> preserved in full — see [LICENSING.md](docs/algeria/LICENSING.md).
>
> The Frappe app id remains `kamra`, so databases, routes, APIs and MCP clients from an
> existing install keep working. The product name changed; the namespace deliberately did not.

**ZIRI PMS** is a full **property management system** for hotels, resorts, and **short-term
rentals / villas**. It runs on **Frappe** (the framework behind ERPNext), is **AGPL-3.0**, and
is built so humans *and* AI agents share the same governed APIs — booking, check-in, folios,
night audit, pricing — with deterministic money (never from an LLM).

## What's new

On **`develop`** (nightly) the product is the **2.6.2** train plus Unreleased
work. The `v2.6.2` GitHub tag is still pending — latest published release is
[v2.6.0](https://github.com/Kamra-PMS/kamra-pms/releases/tag/v2.6.0).

- **Unreleased** — System Health, property time zone, **85 MCP tools** (role +
  module gated), AI provider presets, local-build `deploy/install.sh`,
  banquet Phase 1 (send quote, guest response, Sales/Finance/HK/F&B checklists)
- **2.6.2** (in the changelog; not tagged yet) — Opera-style cashier till,
  folio ledger, cashier PIN, POS full-screen till

Notes live in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) — this list is a pointer, not a
second release note. How we cut stables: [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).

## Why ZIRI PMS

Most hotel PMS software was built twenty years ago: per-room SaaS rent, locked-in data, bolt-on chatbots, and screens that need a week of training.

ZIRI PMS is the alternative we wanted:

| Pain with legacy PMS | With ZIRI |
|---|---|
| Per-room / per-module pricing | **Free forever** (AGPL) — cost doesn't scale with rooms |
| Data lock-in | **You host it** — on-prem, VPS, or Frappe Cloud |
| AI as a marketing slide | **MCP tools** — Claude (or any agent) books and audits with RBAC |
| Opaque pricing & tax | **Deterministic engine** — GST / SST / VAT packs in code + CI evals |
| New-hire training hell | Front desk UI a clerk can learn the same day |

---

## What makes it different

- **Agent-ready, not agent-locked.** [MCP server](https://kamrapms.com/docs/ai-and-mcp) with **85** governed tools — role-scoped, module-gated, permission-checked, fully logged. Connect Claude; no bundled agent to trust.
- **Bring your own key.** No AI markup or model lock-in. Optional [HeyKoala](https://heykoala.ai) for voice / WhatsApp concierge.
- **Deterministic money.** Rates, tax slabs, availability, and no-overbooking guards come from code — never from a language model.
- **Full audit trail.** Every human or AI action: who, what, why.
- **Built on Frappe.** RBAC, multi-tenancy, Desk escape hatch, [frappe/payments](https://github.com/frappe/payments) gateways, ERPNext-adjacent ecosystem.

## Short-term rentals

Same PMS for **villas and multi-site STR portfolios**: sellable units (room / whole-place / package), competition groups, cleaning fees & deposits, Instant or Request-to-book, and a catalog that feels like a listing site.

| | |
|---|---|
| ![STR catalog](docs/screenshots/str-catalog.png) | ![STR villas](docs/screenshots/str-villas.png) |
| **Catalog** — check-in / out + Check availability | **Places to stay** — per-villa cards & from-rates |

### REST & agents

ZIRI exposes **170+ REST endpoints** — the same governed layer the UI and AI use:

- [REST API reference](https://kamrapms.com/docs/api-reference)
- [Postman collection](https://kamrapms.com/docs/kamra.postman_collection.json)
- [MCP tool reference](https://kamrapms.com/docs/mcp-tools)

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-kamra>/api/method/kamra.api.get_quote \
  -H "Authorization: token <api_key>:<api_secret>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"property":"Your Property","room_type":"Your Property-DLX",
       "check_in_date":"2026-08-01","check_out_date":"2026-08-03"}'
```

## Install

| Method | For | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hostinger VPS** | Cheapest self-host (India / SEA) | Buy KVM 2 via the [Kamra referral link](https://www.hostinger.com/in?REFERRALCODE=kamrapms) (20% off), paste the Docker one-liner below · [guide](https://kamrapms.com/docs/self-hosting/hostinger) |
| **Docker on any VPS** | DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, your own box | One-liner below · [quickstart](https://kamrapms.com/docs/quickstart) |
| **Bench** | Existing Frappe / ERPNext benches | Commands below · [guide](https://kamrapms.com/docs/self-hosting/bench) |
| **Frappe Cloud Marketplace** | Managed Frappe hosting | [Install ZIRI](https://cloud.frappe.io/marketplace/apps/kamra) on a private bench |

**Docker (builds on your server):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kamra-PMS/kamra-pms/main/deploy/install.sh | bash
```

Three prompts: site domain, admin email, admin password. Builds a local
`kamra:local` image (does **not** pull from GHCR) — 20–45 minutes the first
time; 2 vCPU / 4 GB minimum (swap is added automatically under 8 GB). Then
open `/kamra/setup`. Update later with `sudo /opt/kamra/install.sh update`.
Details: [deploy/](deploy/).

**Bench / Frappe Cloud:**

```bash
bench get-app payments
bench get-app kamra https://github.com/Kamra-PMS/kamra-pms --branch main
bench --site your-site install-app kamra
```

After install: product UI at **`/kamra`**, booking at **`/book`**, housekeeping at **`/hk`**. Desk remains at `/app`. Sign in as **Administrator**, open `/kamra/setup`, create your property, add staff.

| Channel | Branch / tag | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| **Stable** | `main` / `vX.Y.Z` | Production, [Frappe Cloud Marketplace](https://cloud.frappe.io/marketplace/apps/kamra), [demo](https://demo.kamrapms.com) |
| **Nightly** | `develop` | Previews (nightly.kamrapms.com) |

Production installs should use `--branch main` (`develop` is the default GitHub branch for contributors). Releases are SemVer with a **patch-first** cadence — see [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

---

## Quickstart (development)

```bash
bench init --frappe-branch v16.25.0 frappe-bench && cd frappe-bench
bench get-app payments
bench get-app kamra https://github.com/Kamra-PMS/kamra-pms
bench new-site kamra.localhost --admin-password admin
bench --site kamra.localhost install-app kamra
bench serve --port 8000
cd apps/kamra/frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # hot-reload UI on :5173
```

Rebuild the SPA with `npm run build` at the app root (emits `kamra/public/frontend`). Seed demo data: `bench --site … execute kamra.scripts.seed_demo.execute`. Details: [docs-dev.md](docs-dev.md).

Connect Claude (hosted MCP — no local Python):

```bash
# Kamra Agent → Connect your AI → Connect Claude, or:
claude mcp add --transport http kamra https://pms.yourhotel.com/mcp
```

## Who it's for

- **Hotel / villa operators** — own the software and the data; costs don't grow with room count; AI is optional, not a ransom.
- **IT & integrators** — Python (Frappe) + React, documented REST + MCP, RBAC, audit trails, CI eval suite. Fork and extend.
- **Builders of hospitality AI** — a real PMS tool surface, not a demo chatbot API.
