# FAQ

## Is anything locked behind a paid plan?

**No.** Every feature is open source and included everywhere. Paid
options add implementation and support — plus *connected services*
that carry third-party licensing costs (live GST e-invoicing through a
licensed provider, WhatsApp gateway, payment gateway setup). Those are
services with real per-use costs, not feature gates. The GSTR-1 export
files are free for everyone.

## Why is there no per-room pricing?

Adding rooms doesn't make software cost more, so charging per room is a
tax on your growth. Self-hosting is free at any size; Cloud pricing
scales only with the server your property needs.

## What are the default login credentials?

There aren't any. After `bench new-site … --admin-password <password>`,
open `/kamra` and sign in as **Administrator** or **admin@example.com**
with that password. Forgot it:
`bench --site <site> set-admin-password <new-password>` (on Docker, prefix
with `docker compose exec backend`). Staff should then get their own email
logins.

## What does self-hosting really require?

A 2 vCPU / 4 GB / 40 GB VPS (~₹549–$24/month), a domain, and an
afternoon. See the [guides](/self-hosting/). You manage updates and
backups; both are one command.

## Can I move between Cloud and self-hosting?

Yes, both directions. It's standard Frappe — `bench backup` produces a
full database + files archive that restores anywhere.

## Does the AI ever set prices or taxes?

No. Rates, taxes, availability and policy fees are deterministic code,
verified by an automated eval suite in CI. AI agents call governed tools
as permission-checked users and cannot go around them.

## Which Frappe version does ZIRI need?

Frappe **v16** (with the `payments` app). Install from the `main` branch
for stable; `develop` is the nightly channel.

## Does Marketplace ZIRI include ERPNext or HR?

**No.** ZIRI installs with `payments` only. Company books (ERPNext) and
payroll (Frappe HR) are optional apps on the **same site** when you want
them — on Frappe Cloud or your own server. See
[ERPNext and Frappe HR](/self-hosting/erpnext-hr).

## How does ZIRI version its own releases?

**Patch-first.** Small features and fixes ship as `2.6.1`, `2.6.2`, and so
on. A larger `2.7.0`-style cut only happens when maintainers deliberately
want one — not automatically on every `feat:` commit. See the
[changelog](https://github.com/Kamra-PMS/kamra-pms/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
and [releasing notes](https://github.com/Kamra-PMS/kamra-pms/blob/main/RELEASING.md)
in the repo.

## How do I report a bug or ask for a feature?

[GitHub issues](https://github.com/ilyeseia/kamra-pms-algeria/issues) for
bugs and requests, discussions for questions. Security reports: see
`SECURITY.md` — please don't open public issues for those.

## Who builds ZIRI?

ZIRI PMS is maintained in
[this repository](https://github.com/ilyeseia/kamra-pms-algeria) and is
built on **Kamra PMS** by [HeyKoala](https://heykoala.ai), the upstream
open-source project it derives from. Both are AGPL-3.0: every feature is
included, nothing is gated.
