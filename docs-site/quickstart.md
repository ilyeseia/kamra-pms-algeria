# Quickstart (Docker)

The fastest self-host path: one Docker-capable Linux server, **three
questions**, then a local image build. The installer compiles Frappe +
payments + kamra **on your VPS** — it does not pull from `ghcr.io`.

## What you need

- A server or VPS: **2 vCPU · 4 GB RAM · 40 GB disk** minimum (Ubuntu
  22.04/24.04); **4 vCPU · 8 GB** recommended. Under 8 GB the installer adds
  a swap file so the image build doesn't run out of memory — it just builds
  slower.
- Docker Engine ≥ 24 with Compose v2 (the installer can install Docker for you)
- A domain (e.g. `pms.yourhotel.com`) pointed at the server
- **20–45 minutes** for the first image build

::: tip Where to get a server
One-click / affiliate paths: [Hostinger](/self-hosting/hostinger),
[DigitalOcean](/self-hosting/digitalocean), [Linode](/self-hosting/linode).
Or [AWS](/self-hosting/aws). Prefer managed? [Frappe Cloud](/self-hosting/frappe-cloud).

## One command

```bash
export KAMRA_GIT_URL=https://github.com/ilyeseia/kamra-pms-algeria
export KAMRA_BRANCH=develop
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilyeseia/kamra-pms-algeria/develop/deploy/install.sh | bash
```

You will be asked for:

| Field | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Site domain | `pms.yourhotel.com` |
| Admin email | `you@yourhotel.com` |
| Admin password | (min 10 characters — **there is no default**) |

The script clones `frappe_docker`, builds a local `kamra:local` image
(payments + kamra from GitHub), starts MariaDB + Redis + ZIRI, creates
the site, enables the scheduler, and points `/` at `/kamra`.

## Sign in and set up

Open `http://<server-ip>:8080/kamra` (or `https://pms.yourhotel.com` after
DNS + TLS).

| Field | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Username | `Administrator` |
| Email | the admin email you entered |
| Password | the password you set |

Then open **`/kamra/setup`** and create your property. Product UI is
`/kamra`; Frappe Desk at `/app` is an admin escape hatch (accounting apps,
etc.) — not the hotel.

Forgot the password?

```bash
cd /opt/kamra/frappe_docker
docker compose --project-name kamra --env-file /opt/kamra/kamra.env \
  -f compose.yaml -f overrides/compose.mariadb.yaml \
  -f overrides/compose.redis.yaml -f overrides/compose.noproxy.yaml \
  exec backend bench --site pms.yourhotel.com set-admin-password '<new-password>'
```

## TLS

```bash
apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
# Put nginx in front of port 8080, then:
certbot --nginx -d pms.yourhotel.com
```

## Updating

```bash
sudo /opt/kamra/install.sh update
```

That rebuilds the image from the branch recorded in `/opt/kamra/apps.json`
(fetching the latest ZIRI code), recreates the containers and runs
`bench migrate` on every site. To switch channel or pin a release, pass
the branch or tag: `sudo KAMRA_BRANCH=v2.6.4 /opt/kamra/install.sh update`.
Expect 10–30 minutes; the running site stays up until the containers are
recreated at the end.
