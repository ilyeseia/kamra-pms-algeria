# MCP tool reference

ZIRI exposes **86 governed tools** on the hosted MCP
endpoint (`/mcp`) and the stdio sidecar (`mcp/kamra_mcp.py`). Every
call runs as the connected user — **role** permissions apply, tools
are further filtered by the property's **enabled modules**, prices
come from the pricing engine, and each action is recorded in the
activity ledger.

This page is generated from `kamra/mcp_tools.py`. Re-run
`python3 gen_mcp_tools.py` in `docs-site/` when the registry changes.

## Banquets

### `banquet_availability(event_date, end_date, start_time, end_time, pax)`

Which halls are free for a date, hours and pax. A confirmed function
takes the hall; a tentative hold is shown as a soft hold you can still
sell over. Two functions can share a hall morning and evening — only a
real overlap in hours counts as taken. Run this before every enquiry.

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.venue_availability`.

### `banquet_catalogue()`

What the property sells at a function: menu packages priced per plate
(with their courses), and the service list — LED wall, projector, DJ,
podium, stage, decor, laptop, bar. Read this before quoting anything;
never invent a price.

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.banquet_catalogue`.

### `banquet_enquiry(venue, event_date, customer_name, event_type, attendees, customer_phone, customer_email, company, end_date, start_time, end_time, source, requirements)`

as the first line and a follow-up is diarised, so the enquiry can't go
quiet. Check banquet_availability first.

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.create_enquiry`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_sheet(function)`

One function in full: dates, pax (expected / guaranteed / actual),
every line item with its chargeable flag, the negotiation history,
payment terms, receipts, and what it still needs from somebody.

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.function_sheet`.

### `banquet_add_menu(function, menu, qty, rate, chargeable)`

Put a menu package on a function. Left alone the quantity follows the
pax rule (guaranteed, or actual if more turned up) and the price is the
package's own plate price. chargeable=0 gives it away — it still prints
on the event order, it just leaves the quote.

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.add_menu`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_add_service(function, service_item, qty, rate, chargeable)`

Put a service on a function — projector, LED wall, DJ, podium, stage,
decor, laptop, bar. The catalogue decides chargeable by default; pass
chargeable=0 to throw it in for this function.

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.add_service`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_negotiate(function, discount_amount, venue_rental, note)`

Move the price: a headline discount on the whole quote, or the hall
rate on its own. Every move is snapshotted with what the quote was worth
before and after, so the fourth revision stays explainable. Confirm the
new total with the user before calling.

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.negotiate`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_payment_terms(function, terms, note)`

Set the payment schedule: [{milestone, due_date, percent | amount}].
A term stated as a percentage follows the quote as it moves; one stated
as an amount is a number both sides agreed and stays put.

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.set_payment_terms`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_record_receipt(function, amount, mode, kind, reference)`

Record money in against a function (Advance / Payment / Security
Deposit / Refund).

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.record_receipt`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_status(function, status, reason)`

out as Cancelled / Lost. Cancelling or losing needs a reason. Confirming
takes the hall and will refuse a clash with another confirmed function.

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.set_status`.
Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_quote(function, valid_days)`

Stamp a quotation — bumps the version, dates it, and returns the whole

the hall, complimentary items included.

### `banquet_pipeline(from_date, to_date, months)`

rate, and why business went away. Dated on the event, not the enquiry.

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.banquet_pipeline`.

### `banquet_reminders(days)`

Everything that needs chasing: follow-ups gone quiet, tentative holds
about to lapse, payments due, event orders missing before the date,
functions confirmed with nothing received.

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.banquet_reminders`.

### `banquet_month(month)`

Every hall and every session across a whole month — the grid that
answers "do you have the 14th of December?" in one look. Halls are sold
by session (Morning / Afternoon / Evening), not by the hour, so a hall
can take a morning conference and an evening wedding on the same day.
month is YYYY-MM; omit for the current one.

Endpoint: `kamra.banquet.month_availability`.

### `banquet_close_out(function, damage_amount, damage_note, pax_actual, refund_deposit)`

served, deducts any damage from the refundable deposit — a reason is
required, and you can't deduct more than is held — and returns the rest
as a real refund line. Closes the function.

Mutating — logged to the activity ledger.

### `banquet_register(register, from_date, to_date)`

source).
