# Hyperscaler marketplaces (AWS · Azure · GCP)

Plan big; ship after Hostinger / DigitalOcean / Linode 1-clicks.

## Listing

| Listing | Type | Who pays | HeyKoala gets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ZIRI PMS (self-host)** | Free AMI / VM / container 1-click in *their* VPC | EC2 / VM only | Distribution (+ optional affiliate). Same first-boot: site, admin email, password. |

Paid work (implementation, support, HeyKoala concierge minutes) is sold
separately, not as a hosted SaaS listing.

**Do not** put a paid price on AGPL ZIRI software itself.

## Order

1. **AWS Marketplace** — broadest buyers + ISV Accelerate co-sell.
2. **Azure Marketplace** — Microsoft-centric groups.
3. **Google Cloud Marketplace**.

Bake the image into the machine image at build time with
`deploy/install.sh build` (the GHCR package is private); each cloud needs a
thin Packer / Terraform wrapper + listing copy. Legal entity, tax forms, and a security
questionnaire are required before go-live (weeks to months).

## Near-term money

For independents, earn on **VPS affiliate programmes** instead — sign up
directly with Hostinger, DigitalOcean or Linode. Hyperscaler listings are
a distribution channel, not a hosted product.
