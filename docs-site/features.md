# Features tour

Everything below ships in the open-source app — no editions, no gates.

## Front desk

Tape chart (rooms × dates, drag to move, hourly view for day-use) with a
live **house-position row** (sold/capacity per day, demand arrows,
overbooking flags), **ETA/ETD on every stay** and automatic
**changeover-conflict warnings** when an arrival lands before the room
frees; the Today board (arrivals/departures/in-house with payment chips),
calendar selling by room type, group bookings with room blocks and pickup
tracking, **room blocks** for VIP/house-use/maintenance holds, self check-in links (guests attach a
**photo of their ID** — camera capture or upload — stored privately and
**deleted at checkout** under Verify & Discard retention), and a **central reservations**
screen that searches availability across every property you manage.

**Check-in is a flow, not a button**: from the arrivals board, one
click shows how ready the stay is (online check-in state, ID and
address proof on file, phone/email, VIP flag) with the GRC a click
away — then the room: the **allocator proposes one with its
reasoning** (VIP → quiet high floor, preference matches) or the desk
picks from every free room with housekeeping state shown, and a
warning before handing over an uncleaned room.

**The GRC and the register**: a printable registration card per stay
with **ID and address-proof capture** (camera or upload, privately
stored), an **occupant register** — every person in the room with
their own **ID scan per occupant** — editable actual check-in/out
times, and the stay's money line (advances, security deposits held,
refunds) with a guarded refund flow. Under **Verify & Discard**
retention, every scan and full ID number — the guest's and each
occupant's — is masked and deleted at checkout.

**Revenue controls**: a per-property (or per-room-type) **overbooking
allowance** enforced in code — unassigned bookings can never quietly
oversell a category; **hurdle rates** — when forecast occupancy crosses a
threshold, quotes carry a demand premium automatically and no rate (human
or agent) may sell below the tier's minimum; and a **position briefing**
the copilot reads to the GM: occupancy vs the overbooking ceiling,
arrivals by ETA, departures with balances, conflicts and a 7-day outlook.

## Money

A folio per stay with per-line GST; split any charge by percent or
amount; route lines between Guest/Company/Group folios (alcohol can never
reach a company folio); night audit that posts room nights idempotently
and charges no-shows per policy; GST invoices with per-property series;
allowances, part-settlement, invoice cancellation with a register;
**GSTR-1 export** in Tally / Zoho Books / ERPNext formats. **Cashier** is
Opera-style: till open/close with float and variance, unified FO+POS cash,
petty cash, a shift report, currency desk, and a PIN pad on folio and POS
money actions. Folios use an append-only ledger (Guest / Deposit / AR /
Package). To run full company books (and optional HR) on the same Frappe
site as ZIRI, see [ERPNext and Frappe HR](/self-hosting/erpnext-hr).

## Your country's taxes

Localization packs make invoices native to where you operate, resolved
automatically from the property's country: **India** (GST slabs by
tariff, GSTIN, GSTR-1), **Indonesia** (PB1/PBJT regional hotel tax,
NPWP, Rupiah — community-contributed), **Thailand** (7% VAT, Thai tax
invoice labels, Baht), **Malaysia** (SST with the real 8% rooms / 6%
F&B split, Tourism Tax as a folio line, SST registration number),
**UAE** (5% VAT, TRN tax invoices, Dirham), **Saudi Arabia** (15% VAT,
VAT-number simplified tax invoices, Riyal), and a clean flat-tax pack
for everywhere else. **Currency symbols and number formats follow the
pack** across every screen, report and thermal ticket — an Indonesian
property reads Rp 3.300.000, an Algerian one DA and TVA, an Indian one ₹ and lakhs.

The pack also sets the front desk's vocabulary: the **ID documents** the
desk and the guest self check-in accept (Aadhaar and PAN in India,
National ID and Iqama in Saudi Arabia, Emirates ID in the UAE, KTP in
Indonesia…) and the **ways to pay** offered at the counter, POS and till
(UPI only where UPI exists). The setup wizard asks for the country first
and fills in the currency and time zone from it; change it later under
Settings → Property. Saudi properties get **ZATCA e-invoicing**
(Phase 1): a QR code, UBL 2.1 XML and an unbroken hash chain on every
invoice, credit note and paid restaurant bill, and a per-night
**municipality fee** line where the property charges one. See
[Country setup & ZATCA](/country-setup). The pack seam is open source; contributing your
country is a single Python file — declare `ID_TYPES`, `PAYMENT_MODES`,
`DEFAULT_CURRENCY` and `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` beside the tax functions.

## One-screen walk-in

**Walk-in** (top bar, or the switch in New booking) takes a guest from
the counter to a key in one screen: name, phone and ID; room type and
the actual room (clean rooms first); nights; and payment — cash, card or
transfer, in full or in part. One button books, checks in and records
the advance, all-or-nothing: a locked till or a room that just sold
leaves nothing half-done.

## Deposits before arrival

Secure a booking with a **deposit** at booking time or any time before
check-in, from the booking-confirmed screen or the reservation drawer:
record it at the desk (cash, card, transfer) or send the guest a
**payment link** with a ready-to-send message. The money sits on the
guest folio as an Advance, confirms a held booking, and counts against
the bill at check-in.

## Change rooms from anywhere

Move a guest (same type, or an upgrade/downgrade) from the **reservation
drawer** or the **GRC**, not only the tape chart. The same availability
rules apply, clean rooms are listed first, and the price change is shown
before you confirm. Every move is logged with its reason.

## Guest registration card

The GRC shows a **registration checklist** (ID, address proof, occupants
vs party size, signature), captures documents in one tap, summarises the
money on the stay, and prints a clean card with the room number, the
country's tax labels and the guest's online e-signature.

## WhatsApp on your own number

Connect your own Meta Cloud API number (no gateway, no markup — Meta
bills you directly) and ZIRI sends **booking confirmations and self
check-in links automatically**, takes **payment requests** from the
desk, and escalates housekeeping SLAs to managers. Guest replies land
in a **conversations inbox** — threads per guest, chat bubbles,
replies inside the 24-hour session window — and messages from
in-house guests also raise a Service Ticket on the desk queue.

## F&B — POS and kitchen

Outlet-based restaurant POS with a photo menu, per-item instructions and
guest discounts, plus a **full-screen till and kitchen pass**. The captain
works from a colour-coded **table map**
(vacant / running / in kitchen / ready) and can juggle several running
bills at once — dine-in, room service, takeaway and delivery (with the
customer's name, phone and address carried onto the KOT and bill). A table holds **any
number of bills** (two parties sharing a table each get their own), bills
**split by items** onto a new bill with kitchen status preserved, and
ad-hoc **temp tables** can be named on the fly (they appear as live
tiles until settled). Table layouts group **area-wise** — Main Hall,
Patio, Rooftop — with area filters on the map. **NC (no charge)** bills
need an authorizer (captain / chef / GM) and a reference, print "NC — NO
CHARGE" on the KOT and bill, close at zero and never touch a folio. Tables can be **reserved**
(guest, phone, party size, time) - the tile shows "Res 10:30" with
seat / no-show / cancel actions - and a settled table flips to
**Cleaning** until marked done (auto-clears in 30 min). Firing a KOT stamps a
daily **KOT number** and prints an **80mm thermal ticket** (KDS-only
kitchens can turn printing off); a live **kitchen display** per outlet
(Kitchen/Bar stations, colour-aged tickets) runs alongside. Bills print on
thermal with the CGST/SGST split; walk-ins **settle by cash/card/UPI** at
the outlet while room-service posts straight to the folio. Line voids and
order cancellations require a reason, so the KOT-vs-bill audit holds up.
Guests scan a **QR menu** to order — a captain confirms before anything
fires. The **kitchen display v2** works like a real pass: new KOTs chime
in (sound toggle), the kitchen **accepts/starts** each ticket, items
bump per station and course with **allergy highlighting**, guests and
captain on every card, a timeline with progress, LATE/COOKING aging,
and a **recall** when something bumped too soon. **Inventory & recipes**:
ingredients with a stock ledger, recipes per menu item, consumption
posted as KOTs fire; and the **menu imports in bulk** from a spreadsheet
with a preview.

## Housekeeping

A phone app for floor staff: task assignment *and* a self-claim pool,
accept/decline with reasons, VIP and arrival context on every card,
minibar/laundry posting from the room grid, lost & found logging, and
SLA escalation (overdue → supervisor → manager, with WhatsApp alerts
when a channel is connected).

**Room Board for supervisors**: Housekeeping → Room Board shows every
room at a glance — status, who is in it, who is due out, and each open
task with its assignee — filterable by status and floor. Give staff the
**Housekeeping Supervisor** role (it includes everything Housekeeping
can do). Attendants can mark rooms Clean or Dirty; passing a room
(Inspected) or taking it Out of Order is the supervisor's (or the
desk's) call. Room status changes also respect property assignment and
the Room role permissions, and every change is logged.

**Guest laundry, end to end**: a per-item **rate card** (wash & iron /
dry clean / iron only, with express pricing) managed in Settings; pickup
requests queue to the floor; the attendant **counts the bag with the
guest** — priced from the card, never by hand; the bag tracks
Collected → In Process → Ready; items **return piece by piece**, and a
missing piece blocks delivery unless a shortage note says why. Delivery
bills the stay automatically at the services GST rate through the same
governed path as the minibar. Guests can **request pickup themselves**
from their in-stay page; the desk gets a **laundry console** with
promised ready-by times, overdue flags, printable dockets and a revenue
panel; **house laundry** (uniforms, hotel linen) and complimentary bags
are tracked as volume but never billed.

## Banquets

The function business, from the first phone call to the final bill.

**Prospecting.** An enquiry becomes a function sheet with a follow-up
date, a source and an owner, so it can't go quiet — the morning list
surfaces follow-ups that are due, tentative holds about to lapse,
payments coming up, and confirmed functions still missing an event
order or a guaranteed pax count.

**Availability.** Halls carry a type, a capacity and a minimum, a day
rental and an hourly rate, and the layouts they take. A **confirmed**
function owns the hall; a **tentative** hold is a soft hold you can
still sell over. Two functions can share a hall morning and evening —
only a real overlap in hours counts as taken, including across
midnight.

**What they're buying.** Menu packages priced per plate, carrying their
own courses (with live counters and "pick 3 of 6"), and a service
catalogue for everything else: LED walls, projectors, laptops, podiums,
stage and dance floor, decor, DJ, bar, staffing, stationery. Per-pax
lines bill the **guaranteed pax** — or the actual count if more turned
up — and honour a package's minimum. Per-hour lines bill the function's
own hours.

**Chargeable and complimentary.** Every line says which it is. A
complimentary line is worth nothing on the quote but never disappears:
it still prints on the event order and the pack list, because someone
still has to carry the podium. The sheet shows what the hotel gave
away.

**Negotiation.** Rates move, and the hall's rate moves on its own. A
headline discount spreads **pro-rata across the lines**, so a quote
mixing food at 5% and AV at 18% still taxes each line correctly. Every
move is snapshotted with what the quote was worth before and after, so
the fourth revision of a wedding quote can be explained. What's still
unsettled lives as **open items**, each with what agreeing it would do
to the price.

**Paper.** A versioned quotation, a contract with the schedule, the
policy and signature blocks, the **banquet event order** for the
banquet, kitchen and AV teams (with the menus expanded into courses),
the **pack list** of what physically has to reach the hall and by when,
and an invoice with GST grouped by rate.

**Money.** A payment schedule where percentage milestones follow the
quote as it moves and agreed amounts stay put; receipts that tick off
the milestone they pay; and posting onto a group's master folio so the
rooms and the function land on one bill. Alcohol never rides a company
bill — those lines come back to be settled separately instead of
failing the post.

**The green room.** Holding a changing room for the wedding party puts
a real room block on it, so it genuinely leaves the sellable inventory
instead of living on a note. Complimentary by default; chargeable if
you say so.

**Tracking.** The pipeline by month and by status — confirmed, still in
play, outstanding — with conversion, a breakdown by event type, hall
and source, and why the business that went away went away.

**Phase 1 ops.** Send the quotation by email or WhatsApp, record the
guest's response on the desk (no guest portal), and on Confirm fan out
department checklists — Sales, Finance, HK, F&B — plus a quote
no-response chase.

## Direct bookings

A public booking page with live availability and real quotes, photo
galleries, policies and FAQs, promo codes, **experiences as add-ons**
(spa, safari, dinner), configurable advance collection (percent / fixed /
full / pay-at-hotel — terms are snapshotted per booking), your brand
colour, and SEO baked in (schema.org hotel markup, OG images). Guests
pick **check-in and check-out** and tap **Check availability**.

## Short-term rentals

ZIRI runs villas the same way it runs hotels. Set the property kind to
**Short Term Rental** and the public site becomes a catalog of places —
each villa at its own address, sold as private rooms or the whole house.
Inventory is **sellable units** (room / whole-place / package) with
competition groups, so booking the villa takes its rooms off sale.
Quotes carry cleaning fees and refundable deposits. Instant book or
request-to-book.

## Multi-property

One login, a property switcher, **shared guest profiles across the
chain**, per-user property permissions (enforced server-side), central
reservations, and a portfolio dashboard rolling up occupancy, revenue
and collections per property.

## Dashboards & reports

Property dashboard by department (front desk / housekeeping / finance),
month-to-date statistics (ADR, RevPAR, occupancy), manager flash,
budget vs actual, contribution by source/company/agent, operations SLA
report, cashier reconciliation.

## Switching from another PMS

Export your bookings from eZee, Cloudbeds or anything that produces a
CSV, and the importer does the rest: it recognises each vendor's column
names, detects the date convention (day-first vs month-first), matches
room types by code or name, and maps their status words onto ours. A
**preview** shows the mapping, the rows that will import and exactly why
any row would be skipped — before anything is written. Past stays come
in as guest **history** (checked-out / cancelled / no-show) without
tripping live-booking rules, so returning guests are recognised from day
one.

## AI & audit

An MCP server with 85 governed tools (filtered by user roles **and** the
property's enabled modules), one-click Connect Claude, an in-app copilot
with Settings presets (OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama), rate
guardrails agents cannot price outside, deterministic pricing verified by
an automated eval suite, and an activity ledger recording every action —
human or AI — with who, what and why.

## Admin

**System Health** (Admin) checks the installed version against GitHub,
runs site diagnostics, and points at the upgrade path for self-host /
bench / Docker — no auto-upgrade. Property **time zone** lives on Admin →
Settings → Property and syncs the site clock on single-property sites.
