# Frappe Cloud Marketplace listing — ZIRI PMS

> **Read this first.** Most of this file is the paste-ready product copy, and
> it is branded ZIRI PMS. But the *operational* sections below — the app id
> `kamra`, the existing marketplace entry, the review-request email and the
> upstream PR link — record **upstream Kamra PMS's own submission**, which
> belongs to HeyKoala, not to this project. They are kept as a factual record
> and are deliberately not rewritten: ZIRI cannot rebrand a listing it does
> not own. Publishing ZIRI PMS on Frappe Cloud would be a **separate**
> submission under its own app id, and the build source below is the one
> that would change first.

## Title

```
ZIRI PMS — Smart Hospitality Management
```

## Short description (one line / summary field)

40–80 characters, one sentence, do not repeat the app name.

Open-source PMS for hotels and short-term rentals.
```

(48 characters.)

## Long description (About — markdown)

Do not paste install instructions. Frappe Cloud installs the app.
Do not put URLs in the long description — Website / Docs / Support
fields already hold those; extra links fail the metadata audit.

```markdown
A complete property management system for hotels and short-term rentals,
built on Frappe. Front desk, direct booking, villa catalogs, restaurant POS,
housekeeping, folios and tax-correct billing — one app, no per-room or
per-module rent.

Most hotel software was built twenty years ago: click-heavy screens, add-on
fees for night audit and reports, and guest history locked in a vendor
cloud. ZIRI PMS treats every operation as a governed, audited action, so your
team (and the AI you trust) can actually run the property.

Install it on your Frappe Cloud site from this listing. The `payments` app
is pulled in automatically.

### What makes it different

- **Agent-ready, not agent-locked.** An MCP server exposes 85 role-scoped
  tools, filtered by the property's enabled modules. Click Connect Claude —
  *"book Mr. Rao a deluxe for the weekend with breakfast"* — it quotes,
  books, and logs every action. Bring your own AI; there is no bundled
  model markup.
- **Deterministic money.** Prices, taxes and availability come from a
  pricing engine, never from a language model. Tax slabs, multi-rate
  invoices and the no-overbooking guard are code, verified by an eval suite
  in CI.
- **Full audit trail.** Every action — human or AI — is logged with who,
  what and why.
- **AGPL and free.** No per-room pricing, no per-seat fees, no license
  audits. The same code runs on Frappe Cloud and anywhere else you host a
  Frappe bench.
- **Built on Frappe.** RBAC, multi-tenancy, audit trails and the
  frappe/payments gateway app come with the stack.

### What's inside

- **Front desk** — Today dashboard with paid/due chips, a guided check-in
  flow with AI room suggestions, tape chart with a live house-position row,
  ETA/ETD and changeover warnings, guest profile hub, blacklist.
- **Direct booking engine** — a commission-free, SEO-friendly public
  booking page with check-in / check-out, Check availability, a photo
  gallery, live per-date rates, policies, FAQ, map and pay-at-hotel —
  brandable from an in-app console. Hotels get a room grid; short-term
  rentals get a villa catalog and per-listing pages.
- **Short-term rentals** — property kind Hotel vs Short Term Rental,
  sellable units (room, whole-place, package) with competition groups,
  per-villa locations, cleaning fees and refundable deposits, Instant or
  Request-to-book.
- **Bookings** — multi-room in one flow, group & corporate,
  booked-on-behalf, returning-guest typeahead, add-ons, travel agents with
  commissions, day-use.
- **Revenue** — occupancy-based pricing, seasons, rate plans, vouchers,
  meal plans, rate guardrails, demand-tier hurdle rates, a code-enforced
  overbooking allowance, and cancellation/no-show/deposit policies
  enforced in code.
- **Billing** — folios with per-line tax, corporate charge routing, group
  master folios, exact %/amount charge splits, automated night audit, tax
  invoices with B2B fields, Opera-style cashier till (FO+POS cash, PIN
  pad), append-only folio ledger, payment links via frappe/payments.
- **Restaurant POS** — area-wise table map with live states, concurrent &
  split bills, dine-in / room service / takeaway / delivery, full-screen
  till and kitchen pass, 80mm thermal KOT & bill printing, kitchen display,
  inventory & recipes, guest QR ordering, room posting (alcohol-aware).
- **Operations** — service tickets with SLA, a housekeeping mobile app,
  end-to-end guest laundry, lost & found, shift handover, venues & events
  (send quote, guest response, department checklists on Confirm).
- **Guests** — self check-in with ID & address-proof capture, printable
  GRC with the legal occupant register, editable actual times, a stay
  ledger with advances/deposits/guarded refunds, retention-aware ID
  handling.
- **Messaging** — WhatsApp on your own Meta Cloud API number: automatic
  booking confirmations, check-in links, desk payment requests and a
  conversations inbox.
- **Localization** — country packs resolved per property: India GST
  (slabs), Indonesia PB1, Thailand VAT, Malaysia SST, UAE VAT (TRN), and a
  flat-tax generic for everywhere else; currency and number locale follow
  the pack.
- **Platform** — multi-property with per-user scoping, six-role RBAC, dark
  mode, property time zone, System Health diagnostics, AI provider presets
  (OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama), onboarding wizard, CSV
  migration importers (eZee / Cloudbeds presets), and a 51-check eval
  harness + 13-journey front-desk persona suite in CI.

### After install

The product UI is at `/kamra`. Sign in as Administrator (or
admin@example.com) with the site password and open
`/kamra/setup` to create the first property. Put the live demo and catalog
on the Website / Documentation fields — Frappe Cloud fails the listing
audit if the long description contains any other links.

## Dashboard checklist (unhalt the listing)

The public page already exists at
https://frappecloud.com/marketplace/apps/kamra and shows **Not Available**
until a reviewer publishes. Automated Submission Gate
`AUD-kamra-00003` is **22 passed / 1 minor warning** (no blocking Fail).

Before publishing a new SHA:

```bash
python kamra/scripts/marketplace_install_check.py
```

1. **Overview** — paste Title, Short description, Long description above.
2. **Category** — Hospitality or Other (currently E-Commerce).
3. **Logo** — `branding/png/kamra-mark-512.png`.
4. **Screenshots** — the 13 files above, in that order, with captions.
5. **Links** — Support + Privacy are mandatory; fill the rest too.
6. **Releases** — create / select the `main` release at **v2.6.2**
   (`1533503` / tag [`v2.6.2`](https://github.com/Kamra-PMS/kamra-pms/releases/tag/v2.6.2)) and click **Publish**.
7. If a previous request is **Rejected**, cancel it and publish a new
   one from current `main`.
8. If the app has been in Draft **more than 10 days**, raise a ticket at
   https://support.frappe.io/ (SLA in the publishing docs).
