# Banquet Enterprise — Opera-class guest journey & department orchestration

**Status:** Phase 1 MVP shipping on `develop` (desk-led; guest portal out of scope)  
**Target:** ZIRI `develop` → stable after phased delivery  
**Related:** Venue Booking (`EVT-*`), `kamra/banquet.py`, `kamra/banquet_ops.py`, Events app in SPA  
**Design decision:** No guest portal for banquet — quotes, confirmation, and payment chase stay on the sales desk (email/WhatsApp/PDF + desk actions). Matches Opera’s print/email quote workflow.

---

## Executive summary

ZIRI already ships a **strong banquet core**: function sheet (Venue Booking), catalogue, quotation versioning, BEO, pack list, payment milestones, advances/deposits, pipeline, registers, kitchen indent, and internal sales reminders.

What large hotels expect from **Opera Banquet / Event Management** — and what this epic adds — is the **guest-facing commercial loop** (send quote → customer confirms → chase payments) and the **internal operations loop** (on confirmation, every department gets a checklist and alerts: HK, F&B, Engineering, Finance, HR).

| Layer | Today | This epic |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Sales & pricing | Strong | + email/PDF send, guest confirmation |
| Money | Strong | + guest balance reminders, payment links |
| Guest comms | Print only | + email templates, tasting invites |
| Ops on confirm | Notes on BEO | + department task packs & notifications |
| Food tasting | Missing | + configurable tasting workflow |
| Equipment / AV | Service lines on pack list | + engineering checklist (WiFi, projector, coupons) |

## Proposed feature design

### 1. Guest commercial loop (P1)

**Send quotation**
- Action: “Send to guest” on quote document
- Channels: email (required), WhatsApp (if property configured)
- Attach: **PDF quotation** (and contract when ready) — no guest portal
- Set `quote_sent_on`, log in activity + optional `Banquet Communication Log` child table

**Quotation reminders**
- Scheduler rules: e.g. quote sent + 3 days + no status change → email guest + alert sales
- Desk board: “Awaiting customer response” column

**Customer confirmation** (desk-led — Opera-aligned)
- Guest confirms by **phone, email reply, or WhatsApp**; sales records it on the function sheet
- Actions: “Guest confirmed” / “Guest requested changes” / “Declined” — stamps `customer_confirmed_on` and notes
- Status move Tentative → Confirmed remains a deliberate sales action (or auto when guest confirmed + advance rule met)
- Signed contract: upload scan or mark `contract_signed_on` when signed copy received
- **No guest portal** — banquet stays on the sales desk and department ops side

### 2. Payment comms (P2)

**Advance & balance**
- Optional **one-off payment link** per milestone (email/WhatsApp) — not a guest portal
- Email/WhatsApp: “Advance due”, “Balance due before event”
- Extend `_function_alerts` with `balance_due_guest` when milestone overdue
- Desk still records receipts via `record_receipt()` when paid at desk or bank transfer

### 3. Food tasting (P2)

New child DocType **Banquet Food Tasting** (or section on Venue Booking):

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `tasting_allowed` | Property default + per-function override |
| `tasting_date` / `tasting_time` | Scheduled slot |
| `portions` / `pax_tasting` | How much food to prepare |
| `menu_snapshot` | Dishes to taste |
| `status` | Requested / Scheduled / Done / Waived |
| `chef_user` / `sales_owner` | Notify list |

Workflow:
1. Sales schedules tasting → email guest with calendar invite + menu
2. Chef + sales get in-app + WhatsApp alert
3. After tasting, notes feed back into negotiation / menu composer

### 4. Department orchestration on Confirm (P1 — core differentiator)

When status → **Confirmed**, fan-out **Banquet Event Checklist** instances from property templates:

| Department | Template tasks (examples) |
|------------|----------------------------|
| **Sales / Banquet** | Finalise BEO, confirm pax, issue contract |
| **Finance** | Verify advance received, payment schedule, GSTIN |
| **Housekeeping** | Pre-function clean, green room, post-function reset |
| **F&B** | Kitchen indent, setup style, bar placement |
| **Engineering** | AC setpoint, projector/AV test, WiFi SSID, speed test, guest coupons |
| **HR** | Extra staff count (male/female), bar setup crew |

**Data model (proposed):**
- `Banquet Checklist Template` (per property, per event type)
- `Banquet Checklist Task` (child: department, title, due_offset_days, assignee_role)
- `Banquet Function Checklist` (instance on Venue Booking, status Open/Done)

**Notifications:**
- On confirm: notify each role (reuse `_notify_role` + WhatsApp + email)
- Daily digest until all pre-event tasks done
- HK app (`/hk`) optional view for HK tasks only

### 5. Engineering / AV checklist (P2)

Extend service catalogue + checklist:
- WiFi network name, password/coupon batch, speed test result field
- Projector resolution test, HDMI check, microphone count
- Link to existing AV **Banquet Service Item** lines on pack list

### 6. HR / bar setup (P2)

Fields on Venue Booking or checklist:
- `staff_male` / `staff_female` required
- `bar_setup` (yes/no, style)
- HR checklist task auto-created

## Delivery phases

### Phase 1 — Guest comms & department fan-out (MVP)
- [x] Email/WhatsApp send quotation (HTML body; PDF via print/Open quote)
- [x] Record guest confirmation on function sheet (no guest portal)
- [x] Quotation no-response reminders (guest + sales)
- [x] On Confirm → checklist instantiation from templates
- [x] Notify Finance, HK, F&B, Sales roles
- [x] Checklist UI on function sheet
- [x] Tests for send / guest response / checklists / quote chase
- [ ] `/banquet` board column “Awaiting customer response” (nice-to-have)
- [ ] Attach generated PDF to the send-mail (follow-up)

### Phase 2 — Tasting + payments + Engineering/HR
- [ ] Food tasting workflow + emails + chef/sales alerts
- [ ] Property tasting policy (allow, default portions)
- [ ] Guest balance/advance payment links + reminders
- [ ] Engineering + HR checklist templates
- [ ] AV/WiFi sub-checklist

### Phase 3 — Opera parity extras (no guest portal)
- [ ] Equipment resource calendar

## Technical touchpoints (implementation hint)

| Area | Files / modules |
|------|-----------------|
| Backend | `kamra/banquet.py`, `kamra/banquet_ops.py`, `venue_booking.json`, Banquet Checklist Template / Function Task |
| Notifications | `kamra/agents_channels.py`, `kamra/housekeeping._notify_role`, quotation HTML email |
| Scheduler | `kamra/hooks.py` — `run_banquet_reminders` + `quote_no_response` guest chase |
| Frontend | `BanquetFunction.tsx` (send quote, guest response, checklist panel), `Steps.tsx` |
| Guest comms | Email + WhatsApp outbound; desk records confirmation |
| Tests | `kamra/tests/test_banquet.py` (`TestBanquetOps`) |

---

## Success criteria

1. Sales can **send a quote by email/WhatsApp** and see when it was sent / reminded.
2. Sales can **record guest confirmation** on the function sheet; timestamp and notes visible.
3. On **Confirmed**, Finance, HK, and F&B receive **actionable notifications** within 1 minute.
4. Each department has a **checklist** due before event date; banquet manager sees % complete.
5. **Food tasting** can be scheduled with guest email and chef alert.
6. **Balance due** triggers guest reminder with pay link before event.
7. No regression in existing BEO, billing, or pipeline flows (CI eval harness green).
